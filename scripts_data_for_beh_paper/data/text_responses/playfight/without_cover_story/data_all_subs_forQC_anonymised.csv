I put a lot of effort into this study and I hope my data and feedback will be useful to you. When I first stared the study I lost my internet connection right before I started the experiment and was worried I would run out of time because it took me several minutes to get the internt back up. I was really glad I lot the connection before I started the experiment though so that it wasn't interupted and I was able to put my full attention to the experiment at all times once it started.
